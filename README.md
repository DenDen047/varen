# VAREN
This repository contains the VAREN horse model describen in the paper : _VAREN: Very Accurate and Realistic Equine Network_, by Silvia Zuffi, Ylva Mellbin, Ci Li, Markus Hoeschle, Hedvig Kjellström, Senya Polikovsky, Elin Hernlund, and Michael J. Black, CVPR 2024.

## Installation

Follow the instructions to install [pytorch3d](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/tree/main)
Create a conda environment and install the required packages.
```
conda activate pytorch3d
conda install pip
pip install absl-py
```

Or, use docker.

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up -d

docker compose exec varen bash
```

Clone the repository.
Registed on the [project website](https://varen.is.tue.mpg.de).

Download the checkpoint `pred_net_100.pth` and place it in the folder:
```
varen/varen/code/cachedir/snapshots/varen/
```

Download the horse smal model `varen_smal_real_horse.pkl` and place it in the folder:
```
varen/varen/model/
```

If you want to run the training code you need the dataset.
Download and place the extracted scans `decimated_clean.tar` and the extracted registrations `registrations.tar` in the folders:
```
varen/data/scans/decimated_clean/
varen/data/registrations/
```

If you want to compute the errors on the testset you need the testset.
Download `testset_inside_shape_space.tar` and `testset_outside_shape_space.tar` and place the extracted files in the folders:
```
varen/data/testset_outside_shape_space
varen/data/testset_inside_shape_space
```

## Running the code
To retrain the model, from the `varen` directory:
```bash
./train.sh
```

To compute the errors on the testset (by default on the outside shape space data):
```bash
./predict.sh
```
